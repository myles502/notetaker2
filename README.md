## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- My motivation was to make a way to simply write, and store notes. 
- To streamline the note taking process. 
- this was to solve not being able to save notes easily after writing them. 
- I learned alot about backend servers, the biggest challenge to me was dealing with the code that had already been written and understanding how it effects what I was going to do.
